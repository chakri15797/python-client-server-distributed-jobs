Client Server Architecture
---------------------------------
Step 1:(one terminal)
-> python3 central-server.py

Step 2:(different terminal)
-> python3 client.py 

Step 3: (create as many terminals you want)
-> run python3 client.py in all the terminals

Step 4: 
-> now start giving commands in Server Terminal
-> Commands are equally distributed between the clients basing on job queue size and executed
